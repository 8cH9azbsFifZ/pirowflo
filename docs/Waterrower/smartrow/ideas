    c = Power [W]- the power in Watts, of the last stroke
    c = Ave. power [W]- the average power in Watts since the start of your workout
    a?= Energy [Kcal]- the energy burnt in calories since the start of the workout and every 100m kcal/min
    d = Str./min- the actual number of strokes per minute
    b = Str.length [cm]- length of the last stroke
    d = Str.count- number of strokes since the start of the workout
    Work [J]- the energy, in Joules, of the last stroke
    Peak force [N]- the maximum force, in Newton, during the last stroke
    e = Speed / 500m- the 500 meter split-time, of the last stroke
    e = Ave. speed /500m- the average 500 meter split-time, since the start of the workout
    Speed [m/s]- the speed in m/s, of the last stroke
    Speed [km/h]- the speed in km/h, of the last stroke
    Speed [kCal/h]- the speed in kCal/h, of the last stroke (maybe comes from a at 100m mark with the kcal/min)


Update rate for the data seems to be 0.09s
